# Ender 3 V3 (Core XZ) Gantry Stabilizer Support Rods

## Overview

This is a set of mounts to add support rods to the gantry of the Ender 3 V3 (Core XZ) 3D printer. The support rods are designed to reduce the amount of wobble in the gantry, which can improve print quality. It uses 3/8" threaded rods. This should work with M10 threaded rods too. If not, someone with 10mm rods please contact me and i will happily modify the model to fit.

### Assembly Instructions

1. Attach base mounts. These snap onto the rubber legs under the printer. Pinch the legs together if the fit is too tight. Its intended to be a snug fit.

2. Cut and place heatshrink tube on threaded rods about 1 inch from the top and bottom.

3. Insert nuts into the base mounts. There is a slot to insert the nut on the side. Thread the rods into the base mounts.

4. For top of the rods, first thread a nut, then a washer, then attach the top mount to the rod - BEFORE attaching to the printer.

5. With the rods attached to the top mount, carefully angle the mount to slide the back notches into position on your printer. Once the notches are in place, apply some pressure to the front to snap the mount into place.

6. Add 2 washers to the top and then a cap nut. Tighten nuts BY HAND. These printers have a pretty square gantry from factory so be careful to not mess that up. It needs to be tight enough to hold everything in place, but not tight enough to push the frame forward.

7. Screw in your M3*8 screws to the top mounts.

8. Enjoy!
